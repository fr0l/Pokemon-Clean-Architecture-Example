# Pokemon Clean Architecture Example
This is an example application that shows you a basic structure of and android project that follows Uncle Bob's clean architecture rules. This is a small and simple preview of how we implement both [Passenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.androiddev.taxibeat) and [Driver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.androiddev.taxi) apps at [Taxibeat](https://taxibeat.com/)

## The Goal
The goal of this repository is to help new developers get familiar with this, intimidating at first, architecture.

This project depends on [Otto](http://square.github.io/otto/), an event bus library for Android. If you are an experienced developer you can also refer to [this](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture) repo developed by Fernando Cejas that uses [Dagger](http://square.github.io/dagger/) and [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava).
